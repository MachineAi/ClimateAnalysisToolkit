# What is Climate Analysis Toolkit

The Climate Analysis Toolkit is a free software tool for accessing and analyzing downscaled climate projection models. These climate models have been produced by several agencies and institutions from around the world and published for public access. The Climate Analysis Toolkit allows users to easily do the following:

- Retrieve localized climate projections in a spatially-oriented GIS environment
- Statistically analyze a large number of projections and identify the most useful
- Explore the data in graph and table form
- Use the data to force [VIC](http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/Overview/ModelOverview.shtml), [DHSVM](http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/DHSVM/), or [GSFLOW](http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/gsflow/) models
- Export data to their local computers

### About HydroDesktop

The Climate Analysis Toolkit is a plugin that operates inside of HydroDesktop.  HydroDesktop is a free and open source GIS enabled software application that allows user to explore a variety of climate data from a wealth of sources.  To learn more about HydroDesktop click [here](https://hydrodesktop.codeplex.com/). To download a copy of HydroDesktop (pre-requisite for running the Climate Analysis Toolkit) as well as for instructions on getting the source code click [here](https://hydrodesktop.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20HydroDesktop&referringTitle=Home).

### Development Approach

The Climate Analysis Toolkit is a result of the collaborative efforts of Brigham Young University and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by hydrologists, engineers, and computer programmers. By creating a user friendly application for retrieving and analyzing climate projections the Climate Analysis toolkit provides a useful tool in long-term watershed planning. The toolkit, like HydroDesktop, is an open source project that allows for a flexible and dynamic approach.  The source code is available on this website and feedback is highly valued.
